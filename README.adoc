= RCMS, Ruby Content Management System



== Project Requisites

=== admin/users and access levels

Uers that manage content. They can be ‘admin’ and ‘editor’. More access
levels can be added later if necessary.

The admin can add other admins or editors. Each module (news, articles,
songs) must have fine grained control of which user can do what. For instance,
the user:id=9 may be only allowed to insert and edit news, but not to destroy
them, and he may be only able to list articles, but not list or edit them.


== Post Categories

BEHOLD: When destroying a post category, all the posts in that category are
also destroyed.
